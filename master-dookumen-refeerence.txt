# **MASTER DOKUMEN & SISTEM - Feature Wishlist from Factory Owner Perspective**

*Visualizing myself as a factory owner who loves Odoo and needs a bulletproof Master Data & Documentation system*

***

## **🎯 MY CRITICAL BUSINESS CONTEXT**

**My Factory Profile:**
- Manufacturing facility with 150 workers across 3 shifts
- Producing electronic components and assemblies
- Managing 2,500+ SKUs (raw materials, components, finished goods)
- 5 production lines with different capabilities
- Dealing with 80+ suppliers and 200+ B2B customers
- Export requirements with compliance documentation
- ISO 9001 certified - need audit trails for everything

**My Daily Pain Points:**
- 6 AM: Need to know if materials arrived for today's production
- 9 AM: Quality issue on Line 3 - need to trace which batch, supplier, and all affected orders
- 11 AM: Customer demands documentation for shipment that left 3 months ago
- 2 PM: Auditor asks for proof of equipment calibration history
- 4 PM: Need to update BOM because supplier changed component specs
- 6 PM: Reviewing production efficiency - which machines are bottlenecks?

**Why I Need This:**
- **Morning routine (6:30 AM):** I open my ERP on tablet over coffee - immediately see if any master data issues will impact today's production
- **Example scenario:** I see "Supplier ABC - Bank details expired" in red. I can call purchasing before they try to process payment and waste time
- **Audit preparation:** When auditors come, I show them our 98% master data health score as proof of system reliability

**Business Impact:**
- Prevents production delays from bad data
- Instant confidence that my system is trustworthy
- Reduces "data cleanup weekends" from monthly to quarterly

```

**Real Usage Example:**
- **Problem:** My purchasing officer created "Stainless Bolt M8" but we already have "SS Bolt M8x20" - same item, different names
- **What happens now:** Production uses one code, purchasing uses another. Inventory system shows we're out of stock when we actually have 5,000 pieces in different location
- **With this feature:** System detects 92% similarity, suggests merge, shows impact ("This will update 8 active work orders and 3 BOMs"). I click approve, done in 30 seconds
- **Result:** No more emergency material orders because system couldn't find existing stock

**Real-Life Scenario:**
- **Monday 10 AM:** Supplier calls - they changed bank account
- **Old way:** I tell my admin to update. She updates the master data. Friday comes - 3 payments bounced because they went to old account. Supplier threatens to hold deliveries. I spend weekend fixing this mess
- **With this feature:** Admin tries to update bank account. System shows "8 pending payments will be affected." She creates approval request. I see it on my phone, approve it, Finance Manager gets notified to update pending payments. Everything done in 20 minutes, zero payment failures

**Real Usage:**
- **Situation:** Engineer updates BOM because supplier discontinued a component
- **What I need to know immediately:**
  1. How much will this cost me? (I see +8% cost per unit = need to inform sales)
  2. What's already in production? (347 units - can we still use old component?)
  3. Do I have stock of new component? (System shows 0 stock, lead time 5 days)
  
- **Action I take:** 
  - Call purchasing: "Order 5,000 pieces of MAT-6089 urgently"
  - Message production: "Continue using old capacitor for next 2 weeks"
  - Email sales team: "Update pricing for new orders starting Feb 1"
  
- **Without this feature:** I discover the component change when production stops because we don't have the new part. Lost 2 days of production = Rp 50 million in losses.[1][2]

**Why This is CRITICAL for My Business:**

**Scenario 1 - Audit Day:**
- **9 AM:** ISO auditor arrives: "Show me calibration certificates for all measuring equipment"
- **Current pain:** I spend 2 hours digging through filing cabinets, some documents are in purchasing's computer, some in quality dept, some missing
- **With this feature:** I open "Equipment Documentation Center", filter "All calibration certificates", export PDF compilation. Done in 3 minutes. Auditor is impressed = smooth certification

**Scenario 2 - Quality Issue:**
- **2 PM:** Customer rejects batch - dimensions are out of spec
- **Question:** Was the machine calibrated when we made this batch?
- **I check:** Product made on Dec 28. Machine MILL-003 was last calibrated Dec 17 (valid until Jan 17). Certificate shows calibration was good. Conclusion: operator error, not machine issue
- **Business value:** I can prove to customer that machine was properly calibrated. They accept rework instead of demanding full refund. Saved Rp 80 million

**Scenario 3 - Preventing Downtime:**
- **Daily routine:** Every morning I see dashboard: "3 machines need attention this week"
- **I assign tasks:** "Pak Joko, schedule calibration for MILL-003 this week before it expires"
- **Result:** Never have to stop production because calibration expired.[2][3]
