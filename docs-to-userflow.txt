To build a deterministic (Non-AI) solution that maps a document to your ERP workflow, you need to treat the document as a **Configuration File** or a **Script** rather than a "story."

This approach relies on a **"Controlled Natural Language" (CNL)** or a strict **Template**. If the user follows the rules, the system works 100% of the time without guessing.

### 1. The "Specific Document" (The Input Template)
You cannot use a free-text Word document because that requires AI to understand. Instead, you must use a structured **Excel Template** or a **"Mad Libs" style Form**. This allows your code to read exact cells and rows.

**Recommended Format: The "Process Logic" Excel Sheet**
Create a spreadsheet with fixed columns that match your code logic.
*   **Row 1 (Headers):** `Step_Order`, `Role`, `Action_Verb`, `Object`, `Condition`, `Mapped_Module_Key`
*   **Row 2 (Example):** `1`, `Sales Manager`, `Create`, `Sales Order`, `Value > $5000`, `MOD_SALES_01`

**The "Mad Libs" Sentence Rule (for Word/Text):**
If you prefer a text document, enforce a strict syntax (Gherkin style):
> "WHEN **[Role]** performs **[Action]** on **[Object]** IF **[Condition]** THEN TRIGGER **[Module]**"

***

### 2. The Implementation (How It Works Technically)
This is a standard "Parser-Mapper-Visualizer" pipeline. It requires **no AI**, just standard programming logic.

#### **Component A: The "Dictionary" (Your System Catalog)**
Your software engineers must create a **`modules.json`** file that acts as the "Menu" of your ERP.
*   **Structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "MOD_SALES_01": {
        "name": "Create Sales Order",
        "inputs": ["Customer_ID", "Item_List"],
        "next_allowed_steps": ["MOD_APPROVAL_01", "MOD_INVOICE_01"]
      },
      "MOD_APPROVAL_01": {
        "name": "Manager Approval",
        "role_required": "Manager"
      }
    }
    ```

#### **Component B: The Parser (The Reader)**
*   **Input:** The user uploads the Excel file defined in Step 1.
*   **Code Action:**
    1.  Use a Python library like `pandas` to read the Excel file.
    2.  Validate the data: "Does the text in the 'Action' column match our allowed verbs?"
    3.  **Exact Match Lookup:** The code takes the keyword from the Excel row (e.g., "Create Sales Order") and looks it up in your `modules.json` file.
    4.  *Error Handling:* If the user types "Make Sales Order" instead of "Create Sales Order," the system throws an error: *"Invalid Action on Row 2. Did you mean 'Create'?"* (This forces the user to be specific).

#### **Component C: The Visualizer (The Flowchart)**
*   **Logic:** The parser creates a list of "Nodes" (Modules) and "Edges" (Connections based on step order).
*   **Library:** Use **Mermaid.js** (e.g., `graph TD; A-->B`) or **React Flow**.
*   **Output:** The system instantly draws the box-and-arrow diagram based on the Excel rows.

### 3. Summary for Your Engineers
Give this specification to your developers:

> "We are building a **Deterministic Workflow Generator**.
> 1.  **Input:** A strict CSV/Excel template where users define steps (Role, Action, Condition).
> 2.  **Validation:** A Python backend (`pandas`) reads the CSV and validates every 'Action' against our internal `capabilities.json` registry.
> 3.  **Visualization:** If validation passes, generate a **Mermaid.js** syntax string (e.g., `graph TD; A[Step1] --> B[Step2]`) and render it in the frontend.
> 4.  **No AI:** Do not use LLMs. Use strict string matching and dictionary lookups to ensure 100% accuracy."

### 4. Why This is Better Than AI (For Your Case)
*   **Zero Hallucinations:** AI might invent a feature you don't have. This approach ensures the diagram *only* contains real features.
*   **Instant Adaptation:** If you add a new module to your ERP, you just add one line to your `modules.json` file, and the parser immediately supports it.
*   **Training:** You force your clients to think in terms of *your* system's capabilities, which reduces "gap analysis" friction later.
