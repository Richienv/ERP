A practical setup is to give each staff role a simple **daily cockpit**: a clear to‑do list tied to production orders, with a defined flow from “task assigned” → “in progress” → “finished/handed‑over”, similar to Odoo’s Shop Floor and work order tablet views. Below is a concrete, textile‑specific design you can turn into screens and flows.[1][2]

## Key staff roles and views

Each role gets its own focused dashboard on tablet/PC, inspired by Odoo’s work center tablet view and Shop Floor module where operators only see their assigned work orders and can start/stop them directly.[2][1]

- **Operator (cutting, weaving, dyeing, sewing, finishing)**  
  - Today’s work orders with priorities, due times, and machine/workstation.  
  - Buttons to Start / Pause / Done, plus defect and downtime reporting, similar to Odoo work order screens.[1][2]

- **Line / Shift Supervisor**  
  - Real‑time list of operators and machines with status (running, idle, down), like a simplified visual plant floor.[3]
  - Tools to reassign work orders, approve exceptions, and see bottlenecks.  

- **Quality Inspector**  
  - Queue of quality checks driven by control points on operations and products (e.g. “Check GSM after dyeing”).[4]
  - Pass/Fail, defect codes, photo upload and notes, with automatic feedback to supervisor and warehouse.  

- **Maintenance Technician**  
  - List of breakdown and preventive tasks with machine, symptoms, and priority; linked to downtime entries.[3]
  - Buttons for Arrived / Repairing / Completed, plus spare parts used.  

- **Warehouse & Logistics**  
  - Tasks for material issues to production, receiving finished rolls/garments, and preparing shipments.  
  - Scan‑based pick/putaway with simple statuses: Pending → Picked → Delivered / Stored.  

- **Planner / Production Admin**  
  - Kanban of manufacturing orders by status, capacity overview per line, and material availability alerts.[5][3]
  - Ability to release work orders to shop floor and freeze/reschedule.

## Daily to‑do lists by role

These to‑do lists become the main “home screen” for each persona. Tasks are generated from manufacturing orders, quality control points, maintenance plans, and stock moves, similar to Odoo’s “work orders with checklists” apps.[6][2][4]

### Operator to‑do (example: weaving operator)

- “Run Work Order WO‑WEAV‑1023 on Loom L‑12, Fabric: CVC 30s, Color: Navy, Target: 1,200 m”  
- “Report bobbin changeovers and warp breaks; log downtime over 5 minutes.”[3]
- “Perform in‑process check at 500 m: visual defect scan, density check; record results.”[4]

Status flow:  
- New → Accepted → Running → Waiting (material/machine/quality) → Completed → Handed‑over to QC / Warehouse.  

Key actions on each task:  
- Start / Pause / Finish.  
- Report Defect (choose code: weft bar, oil stain, missing end).  
- Report Downtime (reason, start/end).  

### Quality inspector to‑do

- “Inline check: Loom L‑12, Fabric CVC 30s, lot DY‑2026‑001, after 500 m.”  
- “Final inspection: Roll 23–30, Order: ZARA‑2026‑088, AQL 2.5.”[3]
- “Re‑inspect reworked rolls: R‑45, R‑46.”  

Status flow:  
- Pending → In inspection → Passed / Failed → Rework requested / Released.  

Actions:  
- Record measurement values (GSM, width, shade result, defects count).  
- Attach photos, tag operator/machine, send alert if repeated issues.[4]

### Maintenance technician to‑do

- “Breakdown: Loom L‑12 – warp break sensor error, reported at 09:23.”  
- “Preventive: Monthly greasing for Looms L‑01–L‑10.”[3]
- “Check abnormal noise on dyeing machine D‑03.”  

Status flow:  
- New → Acknowledged → On site → Repairing → Testing → Closed.  

Actions:  
- Log root cause, time spent, parts used, and confirmation that machine back in service.  
- Create follow‑up (e.g. request part purchase, schedule bigger overhaul).  

### Warehouse to‑do

- “Issue 600 kg 30s cotton yarn to Weaving Area for WO‑WEAV‑1023.”  
- “Receive 1,150 m finished fabric from Loom L‑12, store in Rack A‑03.”[3]
- “Prepare shipment: Order ZARA‑2026‑088, 5,000 m Navy CVC 30s, pack in 25 rolls.”  

Status flow:  
- Pending → Picked → Confirmed → Delivered / Stored.  

Actions:  
- Scan roll/cone barcodes, confirm quantities, mark discrepancies.  
- Tag tasks as “urgent for line stop” or “normal”.  

## Example user flows of task completion

These flows mirror how Odoo’s Shop Floor interface lets operators view work orders, start and stop operations, and perform quality checks from one screen, but adapted to textile language.[2][1][4]

### Flow 1 – Operator completing a production task

1. Operator logs into tablet at Loom L‑12 and sees “Today’s Jobs” list (e.g. WO‑WEAV‑1023 at top).  
2. Opens job → sees instructions (yarn type, settings, target length) plus an embedded checklist from the work order instruction/checklist feature.[6]
3. Taps Start → system records start time and sets machine status to Running on supervisor’s dashboard.[2][3]
4. At control point (500 m), system pushes “Perform in‑process check” mini‑task; operator or QC inputs values.[4]
5. If a warp break causes long stop, operator taps “Report downtime”, selects reason, and resumes when fixed.[3]
6. At target length, taps Finish → enters actual meters, waste, and notes → task moves to “Waiting QC” and creates a QC task.  

### Flow 2 – Quality inspector handling a lot

1. QC dashboard shows “3 inspections due”, sorted by lateness and customer priority.  
2. Inspector opens “Final inspection for Order ZARA‑2026‑088” → sees rolls to inspect and sampling plan (AQL).  
3. Inputs measurements and defects; system auto‑calculates decision and suggests Pass/Fail.[4]
4. On Fail, creates “Rework” tasks for finishing with instructions and blocks shipment automatically.  

### Flow 3 – Maintenance triggered from shop floor

1. Operator logs repeated stops on L‑12; system flags a maintenance threshold.  
2. Technician’s list shows “New: investigate repeated stops on L‑12 (from WO‑WEAV‑1023 logs)”.[3]
3. Technician inspects, replaces sensor, closes task; machine color changes back to green on visual plant floor.  

## How this maps to an Odoo‑style ERP

This concept is compatible with Odoo Manufacturing 18’s work centers, work orders, Shop Floor, and Quality modules, where operators can start/stop work orders and perform material consumption and quality checks in real time. You can also borrow the idea of checklists on work orders from community modules like “Manufacturing and Workorders with Instructions and Checklists” to structure operator to‑do items into clear, step‑by‑step instructions.[5][6][2][4]
