# **ACCOUNTANT DEDICATED WORKSPACE - Feature Wishlist for Textile Factory ERP**

*Imagining myself as a textile factory owner who needs my accountant to be productive, accurate, and give me real-time financial visibility*

***

## **💰 MY BUSINESS CONTEXT AS TEXTILE FACTORY OWNER**

**My Financial Pain Points:**
- **Cash flow crisis:** I've paid suppliers Rp 800M this month, but customers owe me Rp 1.2B - some invoices 90 days overdue
- **Costing nightmares:** I quoted customer Rp 45,000/meter but after production, actual cost was Rp 48,000 - lost Rp 3M on that order
- **Tax compliance stress:** Monthly VAT filing deadline approaching, my accountant spending 3 days manually compiling data
- **Bank reconciliation chaos:** 5 bank accounts, hundreds of transactions, takes 2 weeks to reconcile each month
- **Audit season panic:** Auditors request documents, accountant searches through filing cabinets for days

**What I'm Willing to PAY FOR:**
Features that save my accountant's time, prevent costly errors, ensure compliance, and give me instant financial visibility so I can make decisions confidently.

**Why I'll PAY GOOD MONEY for This:**

**Real-Life Scenario - Monday Morning 8 AM:**
- I open dashboard on my phone during breakfast
- I see: "Cash shortfall Rp 240M by Jan 16"
- **OLD WAY:** I'd discover this on Jan 16 when supplier payment bounces, supplier gets angry, threatens to stop deliveries, I scramble to get emergency loan
- **WITH THIS:** I immediately call my sales team: "Push PT Mode Fashion to pay their Rp 280M invoice this week - offer 2% discount for immediate payment." Crisis averted, saved 18% loan interest.

**Business Impact:**
- Never surprised by cash shortages = No emergency loans at 18% annual interest
- **ROI Calculation:** Just preventing ONE cash crisis loan of Rp 500M saves me Rp 7.5M in interest per month
- I'd pay **Rp 15M/year** for this feature alone

**Why This is Worth Money:**

**Current Pain:**
- My accountant, Ibu Sari, spends 2 FULL DAYS per week chasing payments
- Manually checks which invoices are due
- Types same reminder emails again and again
- Forgets to follow up on some customers
- No systematic approach = money left on table

**With This Feature:**
- Every Monday 9 AM: System auto-generates reminder list
- One-click sends professional reminders to all overdue customers
- Tracks all communication automatically
- Escalates to me only for critical cases (>90 days, high amount)

**ROI:**
- Ibu Sari's time saved: 2 days/week = 8 days/month
- Her salary: Rp 12M/month, so wasted time = Rp 3.2M/month
- **More importantly:** Faster collection = better cash flow
- If I collect just 5% faster (reduce 60-day aging to 57 days), I free up ~Rp 200M in working capital
- That's money I don't need to borrow at 18% = **Saving Rp 3M/month**

**What I'd Pay:** Rp 20M/year subscription - worth every rupiah

***

### **Feature 1.3: Automated Bank Reconciliation with AI Matching**

**The Problem I Face Now:**
- 5 bank accounts × 500 transactions/month = 2,500 transactions to reconcile
- My accountant manually downloads bank statements (CSV from each bank)
- Manually matches each transaction to invoices/payments/expenses
- Takes 3-4 FULL DAYS every month
- Errors happen = financial reports delayed

**What I Want:**
